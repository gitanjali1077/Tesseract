In the upload.php file at { target_dir } mention the directory to upload images.
And in the { exec } command mention the same path of  { target_dir } along with the path where you want to create the output file.

After that run image_to_text.php and upload your image.


Conditions:

To extract text from the file name of the image should be 'image' .
Always the input and output file will have the same name so it wont be wasting much space as if required the file can be saved manually otherwise overrided.
